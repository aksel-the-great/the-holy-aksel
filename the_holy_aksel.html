      <h2>Part 1 – bearth of the beast : foundation of global control</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s begin with the unspoken origins. Before the bombs, before the propaganda, before the “gas chambers,” there was the rise of the parasite class — a group that didn’t build, didn’t produce, but “managed” and “advised.” The early 20th century saw the entrenchment of Jewish financial elites in banking, media, and policy-making institutions. Not because they were divine geniuses, but because they played chess while the world played checkers — controlling the money supply, influencing policy, and rewriting the narrative one lie at a time.
|
Europa: The Last Battle doesn't shy away from stating what mainstream historians wouldn't dare whisper: the World Wars were not isolated accidents of diplomacy gone wrong. They were orchestrated steps in a grand plan of destabilization, where the same clique that profits from war also profits from reconstruction. How convenient.
|
Germany, pre-WWI, was rising too fast. Industrial, culturally solid, and a genuine threat to Anglo-Jewish banking monopolies. So what better solution than war? With the right provocations, the assassination of an archduke became the pretext for a global reset. The goal wasn’t peace — it was destruction. Destruction of sovereign empires and the emergence of a controllable, bleeding Europe.
|
And who came out richer? The same bankers funding both sides. This isn’t theory. It’s arithmetic.
|
World War I ended with Germany disarmed and humiliated, not just militarily but spiritually. The Weimar Republic that followed? A playground of degeneracy, corruption, inflation — all under the watchful eyes of international financiers who couldn’t care less about national dignity.
|
Spoiler: they called this “liberation.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Part 2 – Versailles: A Peace Treaty or a Guillotine?</h2>
      <p>
      Ah yes, the Treaty of Versailles — that elegant masterpiece of geopolitical sadism. While the world clapped for “peace,” Germany was being gutted like livestock. Reparation payments so absurd even economists today would laugh. Land ripped away. Military dismantled. And who was cheering behind the curtains? The international banking class. The war was over, but the real extraction had just begun.
|
Europa makes this abundantly clear: Versailles wasn’t a treaty — it was a death sentence written by Rothschild’s pen. Germany’s collapse was intentional. You don't just "accidentally" impose hyperinflation and mass starvation. These are the side effects of a calculated plan to make a once-proud nation crawl on its knees, desperate for any savior, even if he wore a mustache and gave angry speeches.
|
The 1920s were the German Dark Ages — not because of religion or feudal lords, but because of foreign financial colonization. Banks, many Jewish-owned, controlled everything from industry to media. The mark collapsed, bread became a luxury, and Berlin turned into a cabaret of despair.
|
Let’s not pretend: the Weimar period wasn’t a phase of artistic freedom. It was a social experiment in degeneracy and decay, designed to dissolve German identity from the inside. Porn flooded the culture. Gender roles blurred. Morality mocked. Oh, but let’s not question the masterminds — that would be “hate,” right?
|
The stage was now set. When people are starving and ashamed, they don’t care who saves them — only that someone does. And someone did. But we’ll get to him.
|
History books call this period “democratic.” The Germans called it a humiliation.

      <h2>Part 3 – The Phoenix Rises: Why They Really Hated Hitler</h2>
      <p>
      Enter Adolf Hitler. Not the caricature. Not the Hollywood villain with veins of pure evil. The real man — a product of war, poverty, betrayal, and vision. He didn’t rise through nepotism or secret handshakes in backrooms; he rose because Germany was bleeding, and he offered a scalpel instead of a bandage.
|
Europa drops what academia carefully avoids: Hitler wasn’t funded by evil aliens — he was backed by the German people, because unlike their sellout politicians, he gave a damn. He rebuilt the economy without international loans, kicked out parasitic banking interests, and returned dignity to a nation crawling through its own ashes.
|
He said “No” to the Versailles circus. “No” to debt slavery. “No” to cultural rot. And worst of all — he said it loudly.
|
Within years, unemployment vanished, infrastructure boomed, and the German mark was stabilized without the magic tricks of the Federal Reserve.
|
But here’s the part globalists couldn’t stomach: Hitler banned usury. Imagine that. A world power cutting off the oxygen of the Rothschilds. No wonder the war drums started beating again — louder this time.
|
Meanwhile, Jewish media in the U.S. and Britain launched an open hate campaign, years before Germany took a single step toward military action. The headlines weren’t subtle: “Germany Must Perish,” “Boycott German Goods,” “Crush the Fascists.” All while Hitler offered peace treaties to nearly every neighbor.
|
But peace isn’t profitable. Debt is. And Hitler was anti-debt.
|
So ask yourself: who benefits from demonizing a man who eliminated poverty and rebuilt a nation?
|
Spoiler: it wasn’t the Germans.

      <h2>Part 4 – Lies in High Definition: The Jewish-Media Complex</h2>
      <p>
        Once Hitler made Germany independent of the banking leech, the global machine activated its next weapon: mass media. Not tanks. Not bombs. Headlines. Films. Books. Emotional manipulation on a global scale, orchestrated by the same clique controlling Hollywood, radio, and publishing.
|
Europa exposes the full system — a vast psychological operation to paint a reborn Germany as a demonic empire. The same Germany that outlawed child pornography, banned usury, and restored cultural dignity, was suddenly “the threat to democracy.” Convenient, huh?
|
Let’s talk Hollywood. Nearly 100% Jewish-controlled even back then, it started pumping out anti-German films before WWII began. It wasn’t information — it was narrative warfare. “Nazi” became the new word for “nationalist.” “Fascist” meant “you don’t want globalism.” Pure Orwellian inversion.
|
And the British press? Same game. Backed by Rothschild money, it became a factory of half-truths, tear-jerking myths, and fake atrocity stories. The goal? Simple. Make war look like salvation.
|
They told us Germany burned synagogues. They didn’t mention those same buildings were often used to store weapons for Bolshevik groups.
|
They screamed “Kristallnacht!” but whispered nothing about years of Jewish-led terror cells in Germany, financed from abroad.
|
Funny how history becomes “official” when you own the printing press.
|
Oh and let’s not forget the war-time propaganda — piles of bodies shown with captions like “Nazi death camps,” while most were victims of Allied bombings, typhus, and starvation caused by blockades. But hey, Photoshop doesn’t lie, right?
|
Mass psychology is their favorite tool. Tell a lie once, it’s scandalous. Tell it a million times, it becomes education

      <h2>Part 5 – Bolshevism: Communism’s Kosher Engine</h2>
      <p>
      So while Germany was pulling itself out of the ashes, building highways and dignity, what was happening to the east? Oh, just a charming little experiment called the Soviet Union — a utopia of gulags, famine, and mass graves. But here’s the plot twist: the Bolshevik Revolution wasn’t Russian.
|
It was Jewish.
|
Don’t take my word for it. Lenin himself admitted the leadership was packed with Jews. Trotsky? Bronstein. Zinoviev? Apfelbaum. Kamenev? Rosenfeld. Over 80% of the first Soviet government was Jewish — in a country that was 98% not.
|
Even Vladimir Putin himself, hardly a revisionist, dropped the quiet truth in 2012: “The first Soviet government was 80–85% Jewish.” He added, “The Bolsheviks… were not acting in the interests of the Russian people. They were cosmopolitans who had no national roots.”
|
And what did they do with their newfound power? Industrialized slaughter. Over 20 million dead, starved, shot, exiled. Priests gutted. Churches turned into stables. Orthodox tradition shattered like glass. But no outrage campaigns. No “Never Again.”
|
Funny how silence is the loudest sound when your tribe owns the microphones.
|
Europa lays it out: the same financiers who backed the Bolsheviks — Schiff, Warburg, Rothschild — were also deeply embedded in Wall Street and London. That’s not capitalism vs. communism. That’s monopoly vs. sovereignty.
|
Hitler saw it. He called Bolshevism a Jewish weapon against nations. And guess who was funding communist insurgents inside Germany? That’s right — foreign Jewish groups funneling cash to agitators under the cloak of “workers' rights.”
|
World War II wasn’t democracy vs. dictatorship. It was nationalism vs. international Jewish control — in both its capitalist and communist forms.
|
But guess which one the history books glorify?
|
The one that built a wall to keep people in.

      <h2>Part 6 – The War They Wanted: Poland, Provocations, and the Path to WWII</h2>
      <p>
      Let’s kill the fairytale: World War II didn’t start because Hitler “invaded Poland out of nowhere.” No, it started because Britain and global Zionist interests needed Germany crushed — before it became too sovereign to control.
|
Poland? That was the bait.
|
Europa lays it bare: for months before the war, ethnic Germans in Polish territory were being tortured, murdered, and humiliated by Polish forces — under British encouragement. Over 50,000 killed. But the press stayed silent.
|
Hitler sent dozens of peace offers. Dozens. He offered to hold international referendums, to negotiate Danzig diplomatically, to avoid war entirely. He even signed a non-aggression pact with Poland.
|
But here comes Britain, suddenly pretending to be Poland’s bodyguard — after ignoring every German plea for justice. Why? Because Germany’s economic resurrection threatened the entire international order controlled by Anglo-Zionist banking cartels.
|
Hitler invades Poland after months of bloodshed against his people, and Britain declares war — while the Soviet Union invades Poland from the east days later and gets a standing ovation from the same powers.
|
Double standard? No. It’s the standard.
|
They didn’t want peace. They wanted a trigger.
|
The real sin wasn’t tanks in Poland. It was building a debt-free economy, restoring cultural pride, and throwing out international financial parasites. That’s what couldn’t be allowed to survive.
|
WWII wasn’t launched against Hitler. It was launched because of what he was building: an alternative to the global order.

      <h2>Part 7 – The real holocaust was for Germans : </h2>
      <p>
      Dresden, Hamburg, and the Holocaust That Wasn’t Marketed
|
If you think the worst horror of WWII was Auschwitz, congratulations — you’ve been watching Hollywood, not history. Because while the media spoon-feeds us six million sob stories, it censors the real industrial-scale extermination: the Allied firebombing of Germany.
|
Dresden. A city with no military value. No factories. No soldiers. Just civilians. Women, children, refugees.
|
What did the Allies do?
|
They dropped 3,900 tons of explosives on it in two days.
|
Temperatures reached 1,500°C. Bodies melted into sidewalks. People vaporized in seconds. Over 300,000 dead — conservative estimate. Yet it’s not in your textbooks. Why? Because “freedom” did it.
|
Europa pulls no punches: this wasn’t war. It was extermination. Planned, deliberate, and devoid of military purpose.
|
Same with Hamburg, Cologne, Würzburg… All turned to ash by Allied bombers, with Jewish advisors in both Roosevelt’s and Churchill’s circles pushing for maximum destruction.
|
And when Germany surrendered? The horror didn’t stop.
|
Millions of German women raped across Europe — by Soviet troops encouraged by their commissars.
|
Millions of civilians starved post-war under Allied occupation.
|
And let’s not forget Eisenhower’s death camps — open-air prisons where German POWs were left to die like animals. Over a million dead in those “peaceful” American-run camps.
|
But sure, tell me again how the Nazis were uniquely evil.
|
When victors write history, genocide becomes “liberation,” and war crimes become “heroic.”
|
There was a holocaust. Several, in fact. But they only marketed the one that served them .

      <h2>Part 8 – The Holocaust Narrative: Myths, Manipulation, and the Numbers Game :</h2>
      <p>
      Now let’s talk about the “Holocaust.” Yes, the big one. The one they sell on every corner of the world. But what exactly are we buying? Let’s break it down, because the numbers just don’t add up.
|
The first problem: the magic number — six million. Repeated ad nauseam, it’s the number embedded in our minds like a religious chant. But it’s not based on forensic evidence. It’s a political tool invented long after the war.
|
Europa points out something obvious but rarely discussed: this figure has appeared in Zionist propaganda since the early 1900s. Before World War II even started, it was already being used to gather support for Jewish interests.
|
Now, the reality — or rather, the inconvenient truth — is that there’s no real, solid evidence to support the figure. Post-war reports from the Red Cross and various humanitarian organizations put the death toll far lower, closer to around 150,000 to 300,000  ,many of whom died from disease, starvation, and overcrowding — not gas chambers.
|
What about the gas chambers? Funny how those stories didn’t match up with the facts either. For decades, forensic experts have found no physical evidence that these death camps functioned as described — especially when the original “eyewitness” testimonies were often inconsistent and changed over time.
|
But who cares about inconvenient facts when emotion is your weapon of choice?
|
Another twist in the tale: the Nuremberg Trials. Yes, the grand spectacle of “justice.” But here’s the catch: the entire trial was built on forced confessions and fabricated evidence — the kind you get when you apply enough pressure to a man locked in a cell for weeks with no legal counsel.
|
The Allies weren’t after truth. They were after control.
|
And let’s not even get into the “survivor” testimonies, many of which were either contradictory or exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Some people claim they were in several camps at the same time. Some claimed they were gassed, but later admitted to surviving by other means.
|
The moral of the story: the Holocaust narrative, like all great myths, was constructed by a combination of trauma, propaganda, and the psychological need for closure. Not objective history.
|
But of course, challenging this narrative makes you an “anti-Semite.” Funny how the only thing we’re not allowed to question is the official story, even when the evidence doesn’t match.

      <h2>Part 9 – Zionist Global Empire: From WWII to Modern Domination</h2>
      <p>
      Here we are — the grand reveal. The game is still being played, and guess who’s holding the cards? The same players who manipulated your history books and painted WWII as a moral crusade: Zionism.
|
What do you think the so-called “New World Order” really is? It’s not some fantasy conspiracy from a basement dwelling in your neighborhood. It’s a real global network built by Zionist financiers, media moguls, and intelligence operatives who learned the game during and after WWII.
|
We’ve already seen how WWII was used to cement their power, but it didn’t end with the establishment of Israel. It evolved into the deep state we all recognize today. Do you really think the U.S. is a free agent in global politics? Think again. Israel’s influence in Washington D.C. is so deep, it’s practically embedded in the DNA of the political elite.
|
The money trail doesn’t lie. Zionist elites control much of Wall Street, and by extension, the world economy. Banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and the Federal Reserve? You think they’re just coincidences? These financial institutions, stacked with Zionist interests, dictate the rules of the global economic system. From interest rates to currency wars — it’s all part of the plan.
|
And let’s not overlook the media. The Jewish monopoly on global information channels isn’t some “paranoid” theory. It’s a cold, hard fact. When you control the narrative, you control the people. Hollywood, CNN, the New York Times, and many other major outlets are essentially arms of the Zionist agenda — shaping perceptions, controlling discourse, and crafting the “acceptable truth” of the day.
|
What about the wars in the Middle East? You honestly think they’re random? No, they’re engineered. From the Iran-Iraq War to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, these wars weren’t about democracy. They were about Israeli security and the need to maintain a fragile balance of power in the region, with American forces serving as the muscle behind Israeli ambitions.
|
Europa lays it out clearly: the Zionist goal isn’t just survival. It’s total dominance. And in the post-WWII world, they’ve positioned themselves at the center of every global conflict, using propaganda, economic leverage, and military intervention as tools.
|
The game isn’t just about territory — it’s about control over everything: finance, media, foreign policy, and even the global perception of morality. It’s no longer a question of who wins the wars, but who controls the narrative that defines history.
|
And guess what? That’s not about to change.
|
So the next time you hear about a “war on terror” or “humanitarian intervention,” ask yourself who benefits. It’s not the people. It’s not the nations. It’s the same group of people who’ve been playing this game for over a century.
|
They’ve got the power, they’ve got the money, and they’ve got the media.
|
You? You’re just another player in the game — one that hasn’t figured out the rules.
|
So, let me leave you with this:
|
They don’t need to win. They’ve already won. And you’re too busy reading their script to even notice.
|
This is the world they built. How long do you think you’ll keep playing their game?
|
And remember, this isn’t the end of history — it’s just the beginning of the story they’re writing for you. You just don’t get to choose the plot.

              <h2>Part 10 – symbols of evil.</h2>
      <p>
      Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler — their images are burned into every movie screen, every textbook, every lecture hall. Cartoon villains, stripped of complexity, stripped of context. But Churchill? War criminal. Roosevelt? Tool. Stalin? Monster. Yet they get statues, not swastikas.

The Allies didn’t defeat “evil.” They destroyed a rival operating system. One based on blood, soil, identity, honor — instead of money, manipulation, and moral decay. National Socialism may have had its flaws, but it wasn’t what they said it was. And its destruction opened the gates for globalist rule.

Now we live in their world: debt-slaves, identity-less, hooked on dopamine, ruled by algorithms and fake outrage. Masculinity? Toxic. Tradition? Fascist. Logic? Hate speech.

They erased our past to control our future. And they succeeded.

But only because we let them.

      <p>
      And now, what remains? A civilization addicted to its own collapse.

Everything noble is mocked. Everything sick is worshipped. We feed ourselves lies, inject ourselves with hormones, amputate our kids’ bodies and call it “progress.” But dare to say “men are men” or “nations need borders,” and you’ll be deplatformed by a soyboy in a rainbow shirt.

It’s not a conspiracy theory — it’s a conquest. Cultural. Financial. Psychological. A 100-year war waged with ideas, images, trauma, and guilt. And they won — not with tanks, but with textbooks.

But history isn’t over. The truth is still there, under the rubble, under the ruins, waiting to be dug out and weaponized again.

The real resistance isn’t loud. It’s calculated. It doesn’t beg. It builds.

Because eventually, lies collapse. And when they do — the builders must be ready.

Not with pity. Not with apologies.

With fire.
